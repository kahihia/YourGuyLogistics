This distribution provides an easy way to include static content 
in your WSGI applications. There is a convenience method for serving 
files located via pkg_resources. There are also facilities for serving 
mixed (static and dynamic) content using "magic" file handlers. 
Python builtin string substitution and Kid template support are provided 
and it is easy to roll your own handlers. Note that this distribution 
does not require Kid unless you want to use that type of template. Also 
provides a command of the same name as a convenience when you just want 
to share a little content over HTTP, ad hoc.
